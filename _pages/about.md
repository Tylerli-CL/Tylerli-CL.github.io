Welcome! I am **Chengliang** from :cn:, or call me Tyler. :wave: :grin:  

I am a master's student at [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/), Germany, studying *Mechatronics and Robotics*. Currently I am writing my master thesis at [IKG (Institut für Kartographie und Geoinformatik)](https://www.ikg.uni-hannover.de/de/), supervised by [Faezeh Mortazavi M.Sc](https://www.ikg.uni-hannover.de/de/mortazavi).

In 2023, I completed my internship at [OPPO Research Institute](https://www.oppo.com/en/about/), Shenzhen, involved multi-sensor calibration and LiDAR SLAM. In the same year, I completed Studienarbeit (*Title: Room Graph Prediction from Point Cloud Maps*) at [RTS (Fachgebiet Echtzeitsysteme)](https://www.ise.uni-hannover.de/de/rts), supervised by [Julian Kunze M.Sc](https://www.ise.uni-hannover.de/de/rts/institut).

I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), which located in the vibrant city of Chengdu, famous for its spicy cuisine, laid-back lifestyle, and teahouse culture. My educational journey in Chengdu deeply influenced me, profoundly shaping my perspective and sparking a curiosity for exploring new horizons.

I was born and grew up in Qinghai Province, China, a region that is geographically part of [the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau](（https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau）). It is renowned for its high-altitude terrain, vast grasslands, and stunning landscapes, often referred to as the *'Roof of the World'*
